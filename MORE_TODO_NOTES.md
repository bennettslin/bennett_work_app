    * Make sure this is a Bobtail Yearlings essay
* Killing fields of rock
    * Consequential is a description of intent
    * Every generations gets artists who want to be the best for free
    * You don't have to help them
        * You just have to not hurt them
    * The last thing they want is to take the indie deal
        * Their success is a function of how good you are
            * Is the best possible deal anyone can have
            * What they want is perfectly synergized
            * The indie deal disrupts that
    * Consequential artists are consequential even if they aren't willing to admit
        * Like Nirvana
        * And that was probably a problem
    * Indie rock was founded by artists who didn't want to be the best
    * Those who'll take the indie deal are the best of the worst
    * No one thought of the default as interdependence
        * But in light of indie rock
    * Do you think future generations will disagree?
    * Bad news and good news
        * No future country will be ignorant enough to start a Communist revolution
        * No future generation will be ignorant enough to start an indie revolution
    * History is ultimately just a story of consequential artists
        * And Millennials were the first generation to betray their consequential artists
