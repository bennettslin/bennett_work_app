Rock music has gotten worse in the last two decades, and it's no longer controversial to say that indie rock is the culprit. Yet how did this happen? The best way to explain it is with a thought experiment that I call "Bizarro indie rock." ðŸ§µ 1/13

What would indie rock's Bizarro counterpart, its mirror-image opposite, look like? Well, since indie rock is all about helping the artist bypass the middleman, Bizarro indie rock must be all about helping the *middleman* bypass the *artist*. That's as backward as it gets! 2/13

So how does this work? Bizarro indie rock gives middlemen the tools needed to do the artist's job. Of course, they still have to do their own job. But if they're doing both jobs, then they won't be amazing at either one. Luckily, Bizarro indie fans don't expect them to be. 3/13

What happens to all the artists? Many of them got into this field because they love it. They just weren't cut out to be amazing as middlemen, so they took the job better suited to their skills. And clearly, their work benefits the middlemanâ€” yet everyone hates artists. 4/13

Now Bizarro indie rock wants to be rid of artists completely. But if this means middlemen have to do the *artist's* jobâ€” and so, in turn, are excused from being amazing at *either* jobâ€” then any artist can now hope to become a middleman. The job they wanted all along! 5/13

So everyone who was once a full-time middleman, and everyone who was once a full-time artist, now competes for the same hybrid role of part-time middleman, part-time artist. Butâ€¦ this is how indie rock *already* works. Bizarro indie rock is just plain old indie rock! 6/13

That is to say, indie rock is an auto-Bizarro world: a world so backward, its mirror-image opposite can't be any more backward. All that's reflected back is the same backwardness. But why is indie rock so backward? Dig further, and the answer becomes clear: 7/13

Indie rock is really a movement of, by, and for those who would otherwise be *middlemen*. It didn't rid the world of Colonel Tom Parkers; today's Colonels are now the ones onstage. Why be hated for *discovering* Elvis, when you can be loved for *being* Win Butler? 8/13

This is why indie rockers love the idea of a hybrid role that combines both jobs: It's a middleman's fantasy, not an artist's. This is also why indie rock has no love for the *full-time* artistâ€” a lesson learned the hard way by anyone who spends all their time making art. 9/13

Full-time artists *need* middlemenâ€” which means they threaten this hybrid role no less than middlemen do. So indie rock treats them with the same contempt. I'm not exaggerating. The Bobtail Yearlings were there in the 00s; we remember the contempt hurled our way. 10/13

Indie rock has since become gracious in victory, of course. But today's kinder, gentler indie rockers are no less committed to the founding ideology: Every artist must be their own middleman. No one can ever again spend all their time making art, as artists did in the past. 11/13

So this is why rock music has gotten worse in the last two decades: An entire generation of full-time artists got purged by the Millennials, like an indie rock version of the Cambodian killing fields. Only the Bobtail Yearlings lived to tell the tale. 12/13

And now, unless Gen Z heeds our warning, they're about to repeat this tragedy. 13/13 ðŸ§µ
