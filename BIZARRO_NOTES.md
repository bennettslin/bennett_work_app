// TODO: Mention takeover of indie rock during this time.
Why has rock music gotten worse in the last two decades? The reasons are overdetermined, but the most eloquent explanation I can think of is what I call Bizarro indie rock.

What would indie rock's Bizarro world counterpart, its mirror-image opposite, look like? Let's say that in Bizarro indie rock, we love the *middleman*, and we want to empower them by helping them bypass the *artist*. That's as backward as it gets!

So how does this work? We give tools to the middlemen that allow them to do the artist's job. Of course, they still need to do the middleman's job, and they can't be great at both. So now they're just average at each.

What happens to all the artists? They got into this field because they love the middleman, like everyone else. They just weren't cut out to be one, so they took the job best suited to their abilities. 

And the artist's job benefits the middleman, since clearly we can't get rid of the job itself. We can get rid of those who do the job. But if we do, the work they do still needs to be done. Yet everyone hates the artist.

But with the rise of Bizarro indie rock, middlemen are now required to be part-time artists, and expected to be only average as middlemen. Which means it's now possible for any artist to become a middleman— the job they wanted all along!

So everyone who was once a full-time middleman, and everyone who was once a full-time artist, now gets to be this hybrid role of part-time middleman, part-time artist. But… this is how indie rock *already* works. Bizarro indie rock… is just indie rock!

In other words, indie rock is an auto-Bizarro world: a world that's so absurd, it can't be made any more absurd by showing its mirror-image opposite. All that's reflected back to us is the same absurdity.

The root of this absurdity lies in obfuscation. Indie rock isn't loyal to the artist at all. It's loyal to a hybrid role that it *calls* the "artist," but the Bizarro world calls the "middleman." That is threatened by the full-time artist.

The full-time artist and the middleman are two sides of the same coin. To have one is to have the other. And so indie rock was founded to treat full-time artists with the same contempt.

This isn't an exaggeration. The Bobtail Yearlings were around in the late 00s. We remember the contempt we got from indie fans, labels, and writers. Indie rock has since become gracious in victory, of course. But threaten its standing, and the contempt *will* return.

So a generation of full-time artists was purged by the Millennials, like an indie rock version of the Cambodian killing fields. This is why rock music has gotten worse in the last two decades. And unless Gen Z heeds this warning, they're headed to make the same mistake.
