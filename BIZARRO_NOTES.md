Rock music has gotten worse in the last two decades. It's no mystery by now that indie rock is the culprit. But why? The reasons are overdetermined, so the best way I can explain it is with a thought experiment called "Bizarro indie rock." ðŸ§µ 1/13

What would indie rock's Bizarro counterpart look like, its mirror-image opposite? Well, since indie rock is all about helping the artist bypass the middleman, Bizarro indie rock must be all about helping the *middleman* bypass the *artist*. That's as backward as it gets! 2/13

// TODO: Do the next three sections. They should all include amazing or merely decent.
So how does this work? Bizarro indie rock gives middlemen the tools they need to do the artist's job. Of course, they still have to do the middleman's job. And being human, if they have to do two jobs, then they're going to be merely decent at each one. 3/13

What happens to all the artists? They got into this field because they love it. They just weren't cut out to be amazing as middleman, so they took the job that was best suited to their skills. And clearly, their work benefits the middlemanâ€” yet everyone hates artists. 4/13

And now Bizarro indie rock wants to be rid of artists completely. So middlemen are required to work part time as *artists*; but, in return, they're allowed to be merely decent as *middlemen*. But this means it's well within any artist's reach to become a middlemanâ€” the job they wanted all along! 5/13

So everyone who was once a full-time middleman, and everyone who was once a full-time artist, now competes for the same hybrid role of part-time middleman, part-time artist. Butâ€¦ this is how indie rock *already* works. Bizarro indie rock is just plain old indie rock! 6/13

In other words, indie rock is an auto-Bizarro world: a world so backward, its mirror-image opposite can't be any more backward. All that's reflected back is the same backwardness. But why is indie rock so backward? Dig further, and the answer becomes clear: 7/13

// TODO: Keep working on this.
Indie rock was founded by those who, in a past era, would have been *middlemen*. If indie rock rid the world of its Colonel Tom Parkers, it's only because today's Colonels are now the ones onstage. Why be hated for *discovering* Elvis, when you can be loved for *being* Win Butler? 8/13

This is why indie rock loves the idea of a hybrid role that combines both jobs: It's a middleman's fantasy, not an artist's. This is also why indie rock has no love for the *full-time* artistâ€” a lesson learned the hard way by any artist who spends all their time making art. 9/13

Full-time artists *need* middlemenâ€” which means they threaten this hybrid role no less than middlemen do. So indie rock treats them with the same contempt. I'm not exaggerating. The Bobtail Yearlings were around in the 00s; we remember the contempt hurled our way. 10/13

Indie rock has since become gracious in victory, of course. But today's kinder, gentler indie rockers are no less committed to the founding ideology: Every artist must be their own middleman. No one can ever again spend all their time making art, as artists did in the past. 11/13

So this is why rock music got worse in the last two decades: Millennials killed off all their full-time artists. To be fair, they were indoctrinated by the resentful outcasts of a previous generationâ€” like an indie rock version of the Cambodian killing fields. 12/13

Only the Bobtail Yearlings lived to tell the tale. And now, unless Gen Z heeds our warning, they're about to repeat this tragedy. 13/13 ðŸ§µ
