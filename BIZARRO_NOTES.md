Rock music has gotten worse in the last two decades. Obviously, the rise of indie rock is the culprit. But why? The reasons are overdetermined, so the best way to explain it is with a thought experiment that I call "Bizarro indie rock." 🧵 1/13

What would indie rock's Bizarro counterpart look like, its mirror-image opposite? Well, since indie rock is all about helping the artist bypass the middleman, Bizarro indie rock must be all about helping the *middleman* bypass the *artist*. That's as backward as it gets! 2/13

So how does this work, exactly? Bizarro indie rock empowers middlemen by giving them tools to do the artist's job. Of course, they still need to do the middleman's job. And being human, they're not going to be amazing at both jobs. So now they're just decent at each one. 3/13

What happens to all the artists? They got into this field because they love it. They just weren't cut out to be a middleman, so they took the job that was best suited to their skills. And clearly, they perform a job that benefits the middlemen— yet everyone hates artists. 4/13

Now Bizarro indie rock wants to be rid of them. But middlemen are now required to be part-time *artists*… and they only need to be decent as *middlemen*. Which means it's well within reach for any artist to become a middleman— the job they wanted all along! 5/13

So everyone who was once a full-time middleman, and everyone who was once a full-time artist, now applies for the same hybrid role of part-time middleman, part-time artist. But… this is how indie rock *already* works. Bizarro indie rock is just plain old indie rock! 6/13

In other words, indie rock is an auto-Bizarro world: a world so backward, its mirror-image opposite can't be any more backward. All that's reflected back is the same backwardness. But why is indie rock so backward? Dig further, and the root cause is clear: 7/13

Indie rock was founded by those who, in a previous era, would've been *middlemen*. It *didn't* rid the world of Colonel Tom Parkers; today's Colonels are now the ones onstage. Why be hated for *discovering* Elvis, when you can be loved for *being* Win Butler? 8/13

This is why indie rock loves the idea of a hybrid role that combines both jobs: It's a *middleman's* fantasy, not an *artist's*. And this is also why indie rock *doesn't* actually love the artist— a lesson that any artist making art full time learns the hard way. 9/13

Full-time artists *need* middlemen, which means they threaten this hybrid role no less than middlemen do. So indie rock treats them with the same contempt. I'm not exaggerating. The Bobtail Yearlings were around in the 00s; we remember the contempt hurled our way. 10/13

Indie rock has since become gracious in victory, of course. But today's kinder, gentler indie rockers are no less committed to the founding ideology: Every artist *must* be their own middleman. No one can ever again just make art full time, as artists did in the past. 11/13

So this is why rock music has gotten worse in the last two decades: An entire generation of full-time artists got purged by the Millennials, like an indie rock version of the Cambodian killing fields. Only the Bobtail Yearlings lived to tell the tale. 12/13

And now, unless Gen Z heeds our warning, they're about to repeat the same tragedy. 13/13 🧵
